# MOSAIC Data Clean

This set of scripts allows ongoing monitoring and cleaning of prospective data
collection for the MOSAIC prospective cohort study ([clinicaltrials.gov listing](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03115840)).

> This is a work in progress. A full example of the process can be found in Jennifer Thompson's [data cleaning & monitoring tutorial](https://github.com/jenniferthompson/DataCleanExample).

**Configuration note:** All REDCap API tokens for an individual user are
assumed to be stored in the user's `.Renviron` file within this working
directory, in the following format:

`MOSAIC_IH=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
